# Welcome to my little rust project!

## In this project I learned:
1. how to multithread using Rust
2. how to use mpsc for messaging between threads in Rust
3. how to implement the Model-View-Controller structure using multiple threads in Rust

## How to install:
1. clone this repo
2. to run this repo: cargo run
3. when you just type a normal number, this will be set as the current value
4. when you type a number with a precial character, the operation will be executed (if there is a correct operation)
